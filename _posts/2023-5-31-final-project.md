## Background of Project

-During this project, I analyzed two studies focused on the potential health benefits of red wine on cardiovascular health, specifically coronary heart disease. The study was a meta study which cited other available studies, mostly cohort studies, where participants reported alcohol consumption, mostly red wine, and researches collected data on conditions, such as HDL cholesterol levels, related to coronary heart disease, or CHD, during the study. In addition, the authors also focused on the chemical components responsible for this effect. The null hypothesis would be a lack of a relationship between moderate red wine consumption and cardiovascular health, while the alternative hypothesis would be a negative effect on cardiovascular health.

## Finding Datasets

-The study  first mentioned that red wine contained many components known as polyphenols, like reservatrol, and flavinoids which are known to prevent CHD, and have been studied individually. The study also found that red wine, which contained these chemicals, decreased HDL cholesterol and artery inflammations, risks for CHD, with a significant corellation. In addition, diet, weight, exercise, and gender were also usually taken into account for populations studies, and controlled for when the direct effect of red wine was measured. In addition,  Overall, while excessive consumption, defined as over one unit of alcohol, had increased risk of CHD, the hypothesis of moderate red wine consumption having a positive effect on CHD, was shown through these results.

## Analysis
 
 -This results of the study were likely more reliable since multiple cohort studies and evidence based on studied chemical components were used instead of just one study or type of data. Results were alsoprobably more reliable since they could be replicated. In addition, factors that could be independent variables in CHD risk, like diet, were usually controlled for in the population studies. However, not all studies were conducted on human populations, some used animal populations, meaning that the evidence may not be fully conclusive. Finally, in the funding section, the authors mentioned that there was no specific grant, so publish-or-perish can not be ruled out. Overall, the study seems somewhat reliable even though all studies can be affected by bias.
