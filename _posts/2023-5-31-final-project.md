## Background of Project

-For my final Art of Data project, I wanted to analyze data related to the music industry, an area Iâ€™m very interested in. In particular, I wanted to focus on data related to the sales formats of music and how it is affected by economic and social trends. Recently I have noticed an increased interest in vinyl purchases and wanted to learn more about it. First, I wanted to find out whether vinyl sales had seen a significant enough increase compared to digital sales,which have previously been dominant. In addition, I wanted to try to find potential causes behind vinyl sales and what affects music purchases and their format.

## Finding data

-The first dataset I tried to find was one focused on historical patterns in music sales. To do this I found data measuring the trends in music formats and their purchases. While vinyl was originally the only format, and therefore the most popular, it was gradually replaced by cassettes, then CDs, before digital music purchases were finally popularized. At one point, ringtones produced more revenue for the music industry than vinyl. Another dataset I tried to find was data on vinyl sales by purchase location, especially in the recent past. This data was more difficult to find since I wanted to specifically measure the impact of purchases at local businesses, online retailers, and large chains.

## Analysis
 
 -The first dataset showed that recently, vinyl has had a minor resurgence overtaking cassettes and CDs. The only format that remained more popular was digital music, which makes sense because of streaming services and convenience. However, the data showed that vinyl has not reached its previous peak in sales. I was surprised, since there are a lot more options to purchase LPs and EPs at affordable prices, and they have recently become popular collectible items.
 
## Conclusion
 
 -
Finding data on the music industry was difficult since it was hard to find reliable and accurate sources. While I was able to find some on Kaggle and Github, I tried to find most from the official recording industry. In conclusion, this data shows that vinyl has had a resurgence, but it is still not near its peak in terms of sales.
