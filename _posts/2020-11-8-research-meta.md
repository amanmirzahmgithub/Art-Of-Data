## Background of Study

-During this lab, I had to work with a dataset of digimon and write functions to sort through all of the data.
**_I wrote one function that found the average speed, one that counted the number of digimon with a specific type and attribute, and one to build a team of digimon with 15 memory and an attack of over 300._** Some parts of this lab were challenging, however I did learn a lot as a result of this challenge. 

## Results 

-For the average speed, I decided to create 2 variables, x, which would have the total speed of all digimon, and y, which would count the number of digimon.
Since, I knew how to find averages, I realized that x/y would result in the average speed. Compared to the other two challenges, finding the average speed was relatively simple. I already knew how to create for loops and work with lists. However, I did learn how to cast data to a variable, a float in this case, and that I needed to make variables, x and y, global.

## Accuracy of Study
 
 -This function was more challenging since I wasn't sure about specifying which attribute and value would be the parameters. The solution was actually simpler than I initially thought it would be, and I just needed to create a variable a for the type and b for the value. Then a for loop would increase a variable to be returned by 1 each time a==b. This allowed for any combination of attribute and variable of digimon to be counted. While writing this function, I realized that it was similar to mapping keys to values.
